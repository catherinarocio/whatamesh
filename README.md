GCode scripts open up a wide range of formal and constructive possibilities in ceramic 3D printing. Despite these possibilities, designers often limit themselves to creating the formal and aesthetic surfaces that adorn drinking vessels and vases. "what a mesh" attempts to explore which complex forms and structures are possible by programming the machine paths and how their special features can be detached from the purely aesthetic context and embedded in a functional framework. We experiment with porcelain as if it were textile and weave it into filigree, high-strength structures that can serve as filters, sieves and graters in the first step. However, the aim of the project is to create a basis for more complex designs and to open up the technology to a wide range of ideas and innovations.
